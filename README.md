# ThisIsTheWayshrine
Elder Scrolls Online Addon - Wayshrine Discovery and Quick Port Tool for Console (XBox/PS5)

## This is the Wayshrine - a Love Letter to PC Addon "BeamMeUp"
Since 2018, [BeamMeUp](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=2143&so=DESC&page=69#info) has been saving PC players countless hours of toil of manually unlocking wayshrines and figuring out where to go for various Elder Scrolls Online objectives, thanks to the work of [DeadSoon](https://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?action=getinfo&userid=43513) and [Gamer1986PAN](https://www.esoui.com/forums/member.php?action=getinfo&userid=20611)

Although this is not a feature for feature port, ThisIsTheWayshrine aims to provide its own take on the BeamMeUp functionality so that players on XBox and Playstation can focus less on the chores of grinding out location discovery or similar tasks, and focus more on the fun that brings them to Elder Scrolls Online in the first place.
